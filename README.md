## mdmc -- based on MegaDrive++

### Features
MegaDrive++ has the following features:

- **EUR/USA/JAP mode switching**: this effectively **makes your console universal**, allowing it to **bypass region checks** and to **run all games** without resorting to an adapter.
  - If you come from a PAL region, you will also be able to **run most games at 60 Hz**, which means **full-speed** and **full-screen**! Get rid of those **black bars**! See the difference [here](https://youtu.be/X1CW8Da8i1o)!
  - The mod is **switchless**, so you don't need to modify the aesthetics of your console installing ugly switches, but rather you will be able to change the region:
    - Through the <kbd>Reset</kbd> button: **Keep pushed** to cycle through modes.
    - From the Player 1 controller pad: Press <kbd>Start</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> + <kbd>Down</kbd>/<kbd>Left</kbd>/<kbd>Right</kbd> to set your desired mode.
  - The last used mode is saved automatically after 5 seconds and reused at power up.
  - Supports a single, dual or RGB LED to indicate the current mode.
- **Reset-From-Pad** (AKA **In-Game-Reset** AKA **IGR**): Press <kbd>Start</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
  - Supports consoles with both active-high and active-low reset signals by autosensing (i.e.: **all console revisions**!).
